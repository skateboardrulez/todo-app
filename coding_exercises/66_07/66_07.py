# Please download the three text files a.txt, b.txt, and c.txt from the resources and place them in your computer IDE.
#
# Then, create a program that:
#
# 1. reads each text file and
#
# 2. prints out the content of each file in the command line.
#
# The expected output would be like the following:

filenames = ['files/a.txt', 'files/b.txt', 'files/c.txt']

for item in filenames:
    file = open(item, 'r')
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
