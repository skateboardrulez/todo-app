# Please code this exercise in your computer IDE. For this exercise, download the members.txt file attached to the resources. Then, create a program that:
# 1. prompts the user to enter a new member.
# 2. adds that member to members.txt at the end of the existing members. For example, the user here has entered the member Solomon Right.
#
# In the above example, Solomon Right will be added to members.txt updating the content of the file to:
#
# John Smith
# Sen Lakmi
# Sono Octonot
# Solomon Right

new_member = input("Please add a new member's name to the list: ") + "\n"

file = open('members.txt', 'r')
member_list = file.readlines()
file.close()

member_list.append(new_member)

file = open('members.txt', 'w')
file.writelines(member_list)
file.close()

print(f"{member_list}")
