# Create a liters_to_m3 function that:
#
# 1. gets a liters parameter
#
# 2. converts liters to cubic meters knowing that 1000 liters are equal to 1 cubic meter and returns the cubic meters.
#
# Note: Defining the function is enough. You do not need to call or print out a function output,
# but you should name the function exactly liters_to_m3.

def liters_to_m3(liters):
    cubic = liters / 1000
    return cubic
