# Write a program that:
# 1. asks users to enter a password.
# 2. returns "Great password there" if the password has more than 7 characters.
# 3. returns "Password is OK, but not too strong" if the password has exactly 7 characters.
# 4. returns "Your password is weak" if the password has 7 or fewer characters.

password = input("Enter a new password: ")

if len(password) < 7:
    print("Your password is weak.")
elif len(password) == 7:
    print("Password is OK, but not too strong")
else:
    print("Great password there!")
