# The given code is incomplete. Your task is to continue that program. You need to:
# 1. calculate the percentage using the  value/total * 100 formula
# 2. print out, for example, "That is 40.0%" as shown in the sample below:
#     Enter total value: 50
#     Enter value: 20
#     That is 40.0%
#
# The program should also print a message if the user doesn't enter a number for the "total value or for the "value":
#     Enter total value: 20
#     Enter value: hi
#     You need to enter a number. Run the program again.

try:
    total_value = float(input("Enter total value: "))
    value = float(input("Enter value: "))

    percent = str(value / total_value * 100)

    print("That is " + percent + "%")
except ValueError:
    print("You need to enter a number. Run the program again.")
