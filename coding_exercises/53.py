# In the previous exercise, we hardcoded the values 0 and 100. However, it is better to place
# those values in constants. Therefore, your task is to:
#
# 1. create a FREEZING_POINT and a BOILING_POINT variable and store the values 0 and 100 in them respectively.
# 2. modify the function of the previous exercise by using those variables instead of the hardcoded 0 and 100 values.
# The previous function is given in the code area.

FREEZING_POINT = 0
BOILING_POINT = 100

    if temperature <= FREEZING_POINT:

    elif FREEZING_POINT < temperature < BOILING_POINT:
        return "Liquid"
    else:
        return "Gas"
